In this star schema:

The fact table (fact_sales) contains measures such as quantity, list_price, discount, and keys referencing dimension tables.
Dimension tables (dim_date, dim_store, dim_product, dim_staff, dim_customer, dim_category, dim_brand) contain descriptive attributes related to dates, stores, products, staff, customers, categories, and brands.
Each dimension table has a primary key (e.g., date_key, store_key) used to uniquely identify each record, and foreign keys establish relationships with the fact table.
This star schema facilitates efficient querying and analysis of sales data by providing a denormalized structure optimized for OLAP (Online Analytical Processing) operations.
